# Linear-Regression-car-Price-Prediction
Linear Regression Goal is to fit a best line. The best fit line is the one for which total prediction error (all data points) are as small as possible. Error is the distance between the point to the regression line. Linear Regression is a statistical technique which is used to find the linear relationship between dependent and one or more independent variables. This technique is applicable for Supervised Learning Regression problems where we try to predict a continuous variable.

## Problem 
We have cars dataset which includes all the type of cars with their features. A Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts.

## Goal
Goal is to build a model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels.


RFE The Recursive Feature Elimination (or RFE) works by recursively removing attributes and building a model on those attributes that remain.

It uses the model accuracy to identify which attributes (and combination of attributes) contribute the most to predicting the target attribute.

VIF The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is a measure of colinearity among predictor variables within a multiple regression.
